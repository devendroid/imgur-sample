## Libraries Used
In this branch you'll find:
* User Interface with **View Binding**
* A single-activity architecture.
* A presentation layer that contains Screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen.
* Reactive UIs using **LiveData** to Build data objects that notify views when the underlying data changes.
* Asynchronous operations using **Coroutines**
* A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a remote).
* Dependency injection using **Hilt**
* Using **Timber** fo logging
* **Retrofit** for network calling
* **Moshi** to process JSON
* **Coil** for image loading

## App Architecture
This sample app structure is based on Google developer recommended app architecture with common architectural principles like,  
- Separation of concerns
- Drive UI from data models
- Unidirectional Data Flow  

Application having two main Layer:  
- The **UI Layer** that displays application data on the screen.
- The **Data Layer** that contains the business logic of your app and exposes application data.

We can add an additional layer called the Domain Layer to simplify and reuse the interactions between the UI and data layers (Current sample does not included this layer).
